  Disappearing Ruby implements a cool visual feature. A combination of event listeners and event handlers gives me the ability to define how my site should react to the user's action. The reaction I have done for my site, you
     can trigger an event when a user hovers over Ruby like making the image disappear!

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Function Name</th>
      <th>Parameters</th>
      <th>Return Value</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>toggleRuby</em></td>
      <td>Make image disappear and return</td>
      <td>None</td>
      <td>Event handlers that add makes the image disappear in the even the mouse goes over the image and leaves the image.
        If the move is illegal then nothing happens.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>toggleVisibility</em></td>
      <td>on mouse enter and mouse leave</td>
      <td>None</td>
      <td>Changes visibilty style property from hidden to visible.</td>
    </tr>

  </table>
